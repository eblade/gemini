# Stafetten

## The Project

Stafetten was a collaboration art and music project by artist Natalia Chuvashova and Islandery (Johan Egneblad). The project spanned over three years, 2018 to 2020, and the idea was a kind of whispering game where each work would inspire the next. Visual pieces would alternate with musical pieces until there was seven of each, and we'd see where we'd end up. You can now follow our entire journey below!
