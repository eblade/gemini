# New Certificate, New Server

So, after all the talk about TLS and TOFU and security, I am jumping onto the bandwagon and doing two things:

* Switching from Let:s Encrypt certs to a new self-signed one with a long lifespan (even tough it is less safe it is more Gemini, so let's do it)
* After all the security updates and directory traverse bugs and whatnot, I am switching to Agate. I have very simple needs, so a simple server written in Rust, that is also actively maintained, should fit my needs perfectly.

I wanted to "antenna" out the new cert message so you don't get scared when your browser screams about untrusted certificate.

## Spartan

I also started to write on a little Spartan server I thought I'd use for parallel serving of the same content. I don't do any input so it should be exactly the same. The main idea I had was to "solve" the directory traverse thing by serving by dictionary rather than parsing URLs. Since I only serve static files that should be a viable strategy and theoretically inescapable. It will certainly come with limitations such as server-side handling of .. and such will not work. I am not sure that is really an issue though.
