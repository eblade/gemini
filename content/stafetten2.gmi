# Stafetten 2

## The Project

Building on the original Stafetten projects, Natalia and I has made three minor changes:

1. There is a (soft) time limit of one month for each work.
2. We switched who starts (me, a.k.a Islandery this time).
3. More loosely defined, we are trying not to make it as dark this time. The world is dark enough as it is.

As before all the music is CC-BY-SA (give credit and share derivatives with the same license), and the images are ©Natalia Chuvashova 2023.
