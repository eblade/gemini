# Stafetten 2

## The Project

Building on the original Stafetten projects, Natalia and I has made three minor changes:

1. There is a (increasingly soft) time limit of one month for each work.
2. We switched who starts (me, a.k.a Islandery this time).
3. More loosely defined, we are trying not to make it as dark this time. The world is dark enough as it is.
