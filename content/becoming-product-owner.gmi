# Becoming Product Owner

Today was a bit of a weird day. I put on a hat at work which I have never worn before, one that I asked to wear, but that I don't really know what it means. Still it's one that I think is important for our collaboration with other teams, and the future of the thing we make in our team. I am becoming a Technical Product Owner. At the same time I'll stay head developer and also, until we find a replacement, Team Lead. It's a little much, one too many hats, but I think it'll be fine. At least I know it means a few things:

* The thing we are making might be a product.
* Or, maybe several. Who knows, what is a product anyway?
* I get to talk more to the other Product Owners and attend meetings where important things are decided. It's not that I'm hungry for power or anything but I thing this is a good thing.

There are a lot of mixed feelings about the Product Owner role, but I think I will enjoy at least parts of it. I really like discussing how things come together at a higher level, honestly a lot more than the nitty gritty details. At the same time I do enjoy building things, especially cool things. Let's hope I still have time to do that.
